# WASTEX – Waste to Energy Exchange System 🚀

*NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 Submission*

## 🌍 Overview
WASTEX is a modular waste-to-energy system designed for Mars missions. It converts inorganic waste into *usable gases, heat, and electricity* through pyrolysis and plasma gasification.

## 🔬 Key Features
•⁠  ⁠Converts packaging, plastics, and metals into *syngas and char*.
•⁠  ⁠Provides secondary power for habitats during low solar output.
•⁠  ⁠Operates autonomously under Martian conditions.
•⁠  ⁠Integrates *AI-based process optimization*.
